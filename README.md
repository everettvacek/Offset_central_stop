# Offset_central_stop

## Setup.ipynb
Create aperture with central stop and propagate it into far field with FFT.

Compare result to result from 1D Bessel function calculation of point spread function.

## Offset.ipynb
Shift the central stop incrementally to simulate effect of an offset central stop.

Repeat this for multiple central stop diameters.
