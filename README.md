# Offset_central_stop

## Setup.ipynb
Create an aperture with a central stop to calculate the focal plane by Fourier transform.

Compare the FFT result to the result from a 1D Bessel function calculation of point spread function.

## Offset.ipynb
Shift the central stop incrementally to calculate the focal plane of an aperture with an offset central stop.

Repeat this for multiple central stop diameters, recording the FWHM and fractional integrated intensity of the central peak.
